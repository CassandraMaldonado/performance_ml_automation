# Athlete Performance ML Automation

This project explores how manual machine learning pipelines compare to AutoML frameworks in predicting athletic performance outcomes.  
It demonstrates how feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning and automation can be combined to improve both accuracy and model efficiency.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict total lift performance for athletes using body metrics such as snatch, clean and jerk, body weight and height.  
Two complementary approaches were implemented and compared:

| Approach | Platform | Code Type | Goal |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------|
| **Manual ML** | Jupyter + Scikit-learn | Full-code | Build, tune and interpret models manually. |
| **AutoML** | AWS SageMaker | Low-code | Automatically find the best-performing model |
